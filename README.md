# GuitarAutotuner
Group project for embedded systems class at UCI.
We made an Android app that connects via bluetooth to an arduino attached to a step motor attached to a peg winder.
To use it, the peg winder was held on the guitar peg, and a human would pluck the string.
The phone's microphone would pick up the frequency, send it to the arduino, and the arduino would rotate the peg winder to adjust the tuning on the guitar.
Unfortunately, the whereabaouts of the prototype are unknown.
